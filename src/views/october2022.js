               I just added a new game to my site and I think you&apos;ll really
              enjoy it. It&apos;s called Super Mario 64 and it&apos;s an old
              game from the Nintendo 64. You play as Mario and you run and jump
              around into different paintings. I remember playing this game
              years ago during a visit to a old arcade and i loved it. you win
              by beating Bowser and saving Princess Peach.

               Super Mario 64 is an iconic game for a few reasons. First, it was
              one of the first 3D platformers and did really well. The controls
              are tight, the camera is good, and the level design is excellent.
              It&apos;s also a really beautiful game with great music. Finally,
              it&apos;s just really fun to play.

               If you&apos;re looking for a fun game to play, you should try
              this game out! It&apos;s on my site, so playing it is much easier,
              and you can also use a gamepad if you want. It saves to your
              device, so make sure to use the same one and don&apos;t lose your
              progress!
